**These are the scripts used in "Comprehensive discovery of CRISPR-targeted terminally redundant sequences in the human gut metagenome: viruses, plasmids, and more." [10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009428](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009428)
analysis: Scripts used for the basic analysis in the study. The analyses include discovering terminal redundant and/or inverted repeated sequences, gene-contents-based clustering, and extraction of CRISPR spacers.
graph_clustering: Scripts used for spacer clustering based on protospacer co-occurrence graph community.
old: Scripts no-longer being used.
pipeline_scripts: Scripts used for automating the pipeline. The pipeline is mainly composed of downloading, preprocessing, and assembling the metagenomic reads.
utils: Scripts used for simple tasks such as removing gapped sequences, generati
ng shuffled sequences, and converting stockholm to fasta format.
