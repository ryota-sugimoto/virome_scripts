# About

These are the scripts used in "Comprehensive discovery of CRISPR-targeted terminally redundant sequences in the human gut metagenome: viruses, plasmids, and more." [10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009428](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009428).

## Directories

graph_clustering: Scripts used for spacer clustering based on the protospacer co-occurrence graph community.

old: Scripts no-longer being used.

pipeline_scripts: Pipeline scripts used for automating the protocol. The pipeline is mainly composed of process for downloading, preprocessing, and assembling, and collecting CRISPR spacers from the assembled contigs.

utils: Scripts used for simple tasks such as removing gapped sequences, generati
ng shuffled sequences, and converting stockholm to fasta format.
